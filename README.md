Development
The source code can be used only by adding the model/.dbconfig.json file (including database-related settings and the secret key used by the administrator for registration). If you want to use it in your own field, simply add this file setting Thatâ€™s it.
The current development environment uses MySQL
.dbconfig.json format:
{
    "db_schema": "name of Database",
    "db_username": "owner of Database",
    "db_userpasswd": "Owner's password",
